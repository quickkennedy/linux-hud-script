this is a script designed to get a **good start** for linux support.

# main objectives:
[🟩] done | [🟨] in progress | [🟥] todo
- [🟩] fix fonts for linux (literally edits font files to force correct names)
- [🟩] fix folder and file names to be correct
- [🟨] fix logbase to work on linux
- [🟥] fix fonts to be loaded on both windows and linux perfectly without having to install (requires rewriting clientscheme parsing)
